        "2. How to use Status component to change role settings and make agent reaction change. Notice that, when you use Status component, the behaviour guide and example lines of CURRENT STATUS ONLY will be set to agent, that'll save your tokens and make your character harder to be jailbreaked\n",

        "\n",
        "2. 如何使用Status能力插件来根据agent当前的状态调整它的行为指导和样例台词，以实现更灵活生动的表演。要注意，当你使用Status能力插件的时候，只有和当前状态相对应的行为指导和样例台词会被传给agent，而不是全部四个状态的行为指导和样例台词。这样做一方面能够节省你的请求token，另一方面能够让你的角色扮演agent更难被越狱技巧攻击。"
